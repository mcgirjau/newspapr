newspapr is an R wrapper package for [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

NewsAPI provides access to live breaking news headlines and articles from over 30,000 worldwide news sources and blogs. 

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcgirjau/newspapr")
library(newspapr)
```

## Authentication

To use NewsAPI and newspapr, you will need a free API key that can be issued
[here](https://newsapi.org/register). You must then register your key within 
newspapr for the current session. You can do this using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
register_key(key = api_key)
```

To avoid having to run `register_key()` in every new session, you can write the 
API key to your `.Renviron` file, which will then be used in all future sessions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
register_key(key = api_key, write = TRUE)
```

You can check whether you have a registered key for the current session using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
has_key()
```

In case of unexpected errors while using the API, check to make sure the issue 
isn't with your API key:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
check_key()
```

## Endpoints

`newspapr` supports all 3 of the NewsAPI [endpoints](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints):

 - `/v2/top-headlines` - live top and breaking headlines
 - `/v2/everything` - millions of articles from over 30,000 large and small news sources and blogs
