[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

newspapr is a wrapper package for [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) in R.

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcgirjau/newspapr")
library(newspapr)
```

## Authentication

To use NewsAPI and newspapr, you will need a free API key that can be issued
[here](https://newsapi.org/account). You must then register your key within 
newspapr for the current session. You can do this using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
register_key(key = api_key)
```

To avoid having to run `register_key()` in every new session, you can write the 
API key to your `.Renviron` file, which will then be used in all future sessions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
register_key(key = api_key, write = TRUE)
```

You can check whether you have a registered key for the current session using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
has_key()
```

In case of unexpected errors while using the API, check to make sure the issue 
isn't with your API key:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
check_key()
```

## Endpoints

`newspapr` supports all 3 of the NewsAPI
[endpoints](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints):

 - `/v2/top-headlines`
 - `/v2/everything`
 - `/v2/sources`

<!-- # TO DO -->

<!-- - write package to mirror exactly all capabilities of the NewsAPI -->
<!-- - create Shiny app to implement all of the functions written in GUI form -->
<!-- - implement special machine learning algorithm to detect if news headline is -->
<!-- sensationalist or not -->
<!-- - word cloud generator -->
<!-- - sentiment analysis (i.e. put in given term, be told if news are good or bad) -->
<!-- - trend plots of terms over time -->
<!-- - daily update feature (today's top news based on user preference) -->

<!-- For the Shiny client, things to include: -->

<!-- - set preferred languages -->
<!-- - choose publication -->
