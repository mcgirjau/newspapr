[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

newspapr is an R wrapper package for [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcgirjau/newspapr")
library(newspapr)
```

## Authentication

To use NewsAPI and newspapr, you will need a free API key that can be
issued [here](https://newsapi.org/account). You must then register your
key within newspapr for the current session. You can do this using:

``` r
register_key(key = api_key)
```

To avoid having to run `register_key()` in every new session, you can
write the API key to your `.Renviron` file, which will then be used in
all future sessions:

``` r
register_key(key = api_key, write = TRUE)
```

You can check whether you have a registered key for the current session
using:

``` r
has_key()
```

In case of unexpected errors while using the API, check to make sure the
issue isnâ€™t with your API key:

``` r
check_key()
```

## Endpoints

`newspapr` supports all 3 of the NewsAPI
[endpoints](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints):

  - `/v2/top-headlines`
  - `/v2/everything`
